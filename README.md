# Activity Prediction using Wisdm Dataset

This notebook is from one of my assignments from my Distributed Computing Course. In this course, we mainly focused on using PySpark and learned the benefits of distributed computing. This assignment focused on parsing through text files, cleaning the data, and producing a basic Logistic Regression to classify whether the activity was related to eating or not. Data for this project can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WISDM+Smartphone+and+Smartwatch+Activity+and+Biometrics+Dataset+).
